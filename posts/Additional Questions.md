#### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I spent five hours on this test, I would improve the design of the home page and maybe add a search function to make it easier to navigate the data.

#### 2. What alternative approaches/solutions to the user story did you consider when engineering your solution? What benefits/downsides would they have had compared to the selected solution?

I focused on making my solution simple, fast and easy to understand, using NextJs made my application production ready. I considered simply using reactJs alone which will give practically the same solution but I just wanted to make the load and refresh very fast. 

#### 3. What additional features/improvements do you think could help the customer gain more value from your application?

As I mentioned before, loading all the data regarding the infected states and add a search function besides the data table. 
Those are the major improvements needed. 


#### 4. Where do you see issues in your code that might cause issues in the future? How would you monitor the performance of your app?

At this stage the app will run smoothly even with much more components added. We are using nextJS in our platform and it's just incredible. 
I would have liked to implement redux to give a better state management but I don't really think its beneficial for such a small application.

#### 5. How would you improve the API that you just used or its documentation?

I was never a fan of nested json files so I would improve the data display to make it a bit cleaner.

#### 6. What did you think about this test? How interesting was it for you? How would you recommend us to improve the test?

it was really a good test but in my case it's was a bit difficult to give it more time because of my work load. I would enjoy a technical interview even better since it will focus on the exact requirements of the position. 
This acutely gave me a chance to implement nextJs for scratch which is my first time doing it. I would say, very beneficial test.
